## Image Search App 📷

## Overview 📄
This small, silly, non-optimized project was built as part of the "coding-challenge-full-stack-js" challenge. Original challenge can be found inside of [this repo](https://github.com/crewfire/coding-challenge-full-stack-js). I've decided to use the Unsplash API instead of Flickr. Ops, my bad 🤓
